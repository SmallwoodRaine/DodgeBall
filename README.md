Welcome to Dodgeballs. This is a very simple game, that I created to give me some experience with pygame/python. The point of the game is too spawn as many balls as you can without being hit by the ones that you have already previously spawned. 

Controls
  -shoot directionally with "w,a,s,d"
  -move with arrow-keys

I am hoping to later program a neural network to master the game.
